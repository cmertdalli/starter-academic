abstract: Since the collapse of the communist regimes of the Soviet Union and
  Yugoslavia, the welfare regimes in Central and Eastern Europe have been
  fundamentally transformed in accordance with the process of economic
  liberalization in these countries. However, the underlying factors behind the
  diverging paths and trajectories of post-communist welfare states have yet to
  be understood. Compiling a new dataset covering sixteen countries from 1996 to
  2016, this thesis presents a quantitative analysis to explore the
  underpinnings of welfare state development in post-communist states. First,
  informed by the Quality of Government (QoG) theory, the empirical evidence
  shows that institutionalization of electoral democracy and good governance
  practices play a central role in ensuring welfare efforts. Second, this study
  suggests that budgetary deficits and low economic performance have a
  significant negative impact on the level of social spending, as the productive
  use of economic resources is prioritized in those developing economies.
  Finally, in contrast with power resource theory, the results of this thesis
  provide evidence that parliamentary party composition has no effect on social
  welfare outcomes in this particular context.
